Personal Dotfiles
=================

This repository contains my personal dotfiles.  To install, enter
these commands in bash:

    git clone https://github.com/sakenogawa/dotfiles.git Dotfiles
    cd Dotfiles
    ./install.sh

This will also clone and install Vim plugins via Vundle. Since the
theme will not have been installed at that time, you will have to
confirm once by pressing the enter key.
